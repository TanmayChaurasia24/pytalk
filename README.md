**Welcome to PyTalk!**

PyTalk is a Python-based text-to-speech interaction program created by Tanmay. With PyTalk, you can type text, and the program will convert it into speech, allowing your computer to 'talk' back to you.

### Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** PyTalk offers a straightforward interface where you can type your input, and the program will speak it out using text-to-speech technology.

- **Custom Responses:** PyTalk is equipped with a few predefined responses. Ask "what is your name," and PyTalk will introduce itself. Type "exit," and PyTalk will bid you farewell.

- **Adjustable Voice Properties:** The program allows you to adjust the speech rate and volume to personalize the output according to your preferences.
